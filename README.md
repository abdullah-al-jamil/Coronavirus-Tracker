# Coronavirus-Tracker
Coronavirus Tracker is a java Springboot application that shows the total and new coronavirus cases around the world. It also shows the state-based coronavirus cases in a country. The data I used for this project was taken from [this](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) github repository.
